        "title": "Winning A Dev.Post Hackathon - Tiles@MapHub, OpenStreetMap with Dustin Wilson | HackBuddy",
        "description": "Presented by HackBuddy, a meetup group from Southern California that learns web programming together now ONLINE.  Join us from around the world, simply get on the mailing list via: https://javascriptla.net.    \n\nTiles@Maphub allows users to query through hundreds of GB of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and dynamically construct custom vector layers from this data. Tiles relies on a PostGIS DB tuned for fast geospatial queries on the newest generation of AWS Graviton processors. Tiles was built using AWS ECS as a container orchestrator, PostGIS as the DB, Redis as an API cache, Go for APIs, and vanilla Javascript for the frontend.\n\nDustin Wilson is a backend engineer at Numina, a start-up that deploys remote sensors to measure how people and objects move in streets and public spaces. Wilson also contributes content to Codecademy, where he focuses on building content for Databases and Computer Science courses (e.g. DB Design with PostgreSQL, CS103: Databases). Before Numina, Wilson was a Data Engineer at Geophy, a Dutch real-estate tech company. Dustin has a B.A in Economics from Columbia University.\n\nEnjoy the video! Thumbs up if you liked, leave comments below and SUBSCRIBE if you're new!  See you at the next meetup. Visit our website at:  https://javascriptla.net for more meetup and event announcements!\n\nWant to learn other programming languages too?\nVisit https://hackbuddy.com  \n\nChat via:\nDiscord via invite link: https://discord.gg/KWFymAh\nSlack Link: https://javascriptla.herokuapp.com\n\nYou can also follow us on all relevant social media:\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/javascriptla\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/javascriptninja\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/javascriptla\nLinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/javascriptla\nThanks for watching! - Vijay, Organizer\nhttps://javascriptla.net",

          "title": "Winning A Dev.Post Hackathon - Tiles@MapHub, OpenStreetMap with Dustin Wilson | HackBuddy",
          "description": "Presented by HackBuddy, a meetup group from Southern California that learns web programming together now ONLINE.  Join us from around the world, simply get on the mailing list via: https://javascriptla.net.    \n\nTiles@Maphub allows users to query through hundreds of GB of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and dynamically construct custom vector layers from this data. Tiles relies on a PostGIS DB tuned for fast geospatial queries on the newest generation of AWS Graviton processors. Tiles was built using AWS ECS as a container orchestrator, PostGIS as the DB, Redis as an API cache, Go for APIs, and vanilla Javascript for the frontend.\n\nDustin Wilson is a backend engineer at Numina, a start-up that deploys remote sensors to measure how people and objects move in streets and public spaces. Wilson also contributes content to Codecademy, where he focuses on building content for Databases and Computer Science courses (e.g. DB Design with PostgreSQL, CS103: Databases). Before Numina, Wilson was a Data Engineer at Geophy, a Dutch real-estate tech company. Dustin has a B.A in Economics from Columbia University.\n\nEnjoy the video!
